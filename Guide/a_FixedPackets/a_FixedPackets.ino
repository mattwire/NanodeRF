/*
  The first task of the base station is to receive data packets from the wireless nodes.
  
  This example shows the simplest way to receive packets it uses a struct: "a structured record
  type that aggregates a fixed set of labelled objects, possibly of different types, into a single object" - Wikipedia
  
  This struct is used to tell the program how to extract individual elements from the packet data received.
  It tells the program that the first variable is an integer or second could be a float for example.
  It requires that the same struct definition is used on the transmitting node.
  
  Use the emonTxFirmware > Guide > g_TransmittingData example to send data to be recieved by this sketch.
