To make this work you will need:
Arduino 1.x:					http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
EtherCard: 					https://github.com/jcw/ethercard
JeeLib: 					https://github.com/jcw/jeelib
RTClib:                                         https://github.com/jcw/rtclib

The is a collaboration between OpenEnergyMonitor.org and Nanode.eu (Ken Boak) 

This repo contains the firmware to allow a Nanodes equipped with a RFM12B breakout board or NanodeRF's with RFM12B onboard to received monitoring data from the emonTx and post the data online to emoncms.

The same frequency RFM12B's should be used on both the emonTx and NanodeRF, the frequency of the modules must also be set in the sketch.
 

Older version of the Nanode can be used with certain changes, see: http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/227

For Older emonBase/NanodeRF examples which use the EtherShield library (now un-supported) see: https://github.com/openenergymonitor/NanodeRF_ethershield

NanodeRF_PowerRTCrelay_GLCDtemp: example to receive data via RFM12B wireless from emonTx and post to emoncms, decode header to extract current time, transmmitt time to emonGLCD display, receive temperature from emonGLCD's on-board temperature sensor. See: http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.com/2012/01/emonglcd-getting-time-for-internet.html

NanodeRF_Cosm (BETA): Receive data from emonTx via RFM12B wireless and post to Cosum. Just insert your Cosm feed ID and API Key. Thanks to Roger James for this contribution. See forum thread for discussion: http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/376
